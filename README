Hello and welcome to my fluids simulation.  To run the simulation you will need CMAKE.

the comands in Linux are as follows:
[in the format of description: what to type]

from the main project directory(NOT THE SRC DIRECCTORY) go to the build directory: cd ./build
remove all files in the folder: rm -r *
make the compiler: cmake ../src
compile the code: make install
run the code: ../fluids


The simulation responds to mouse and keyboard input.  The mouse changes the velocity fields and adds densities, while the keyboard changes the simulation parameters.

Mouse:
left click, hold, move, and release to create a velocity field.  The farther you move while holding down the left button the more velocity you impose.
right click to add density clouds

Keys:
F1: full screen mode
r: reset the simulation
v: toggle the display of the velocity vectors
s: creates a sphere boundary: doesn't work too well, I wouldn't recommend it, the BC's aren't quite right for this
q: add a cube boundary where the mouse is
h: add a constant source of density - useful for inflow/outflow simulations
1: add a horizontal density line
2: add a vertical density line (to show flow through a pipe
p: turn on particle mode, it doesn't work but it may look cool
f: turn on "fire" rendering mode
i: begin an inflow/outflow simulation
l: begin a lid driven cavity flow
up arrow\down: change viscosity by a small aount
Rshift + up arrow\down: change viscosity by a large amount
left\right arrow: chane diffusivity by a small amount
RSHIFT left\right arrow: change diffuisivity by a large amount
c: clear the density, but don't reset the simulation

Any questions or comments email: taylorstine@gmail.com

sources: this fluid simulator is based on "Real-time Rendering of Fluids for Games" a paper by Jos Stam


Trouble shooting:

I get some kind of window compatability error when I run the executable, what's up with that?
-That's because I have a 32 bit machine, and you probably have a 64 bit machine(Mr. Rockafeller) so you'll have to compile the code yourself to create an executable file.
